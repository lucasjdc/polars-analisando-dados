Among the deserts, the walnut tart was superb, but i didn\\'t like the peanut-butter mousse at all.\\\\n\\\\nBut, in spite of all that, the reason for the 5-star rating is the service we got. We were served by Mr.Nanda, who made us feel absolutely special. He didn\\'t have to. We were a small party of just two people, we weren\\'t ordering off the main menu, and the restaurant discourages tips. In spite of all that, he was extremely attentive (without being intrusive), engaging and helpful.
